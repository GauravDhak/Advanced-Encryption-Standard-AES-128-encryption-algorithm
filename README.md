# Advanced-Encryption-Standard-AES-128-encryption-algorithm
This project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) encryption algorithm on an FPGA development board to enable real-time secure data communication. AES is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST and widely used for securing digital information.  By leveraging the parallelism of FPGA architectures.
