# AES Encryption Algorithm Implementation Using FPGA Board for Secure Data Communication

## üîê Introduction

This project implements the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128)** encryption algorithm on an **FPGA development board** to enable **real-time secure data communication**. AES is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST and widely used for securing digital information.

By leveraging the parallelism of FPGA architectures, the project achieves high-speed encryption suitable for applications in embedded systems, secure IoT devices, and real-time data transmission. The entire design is described in Verilog HDL and simulated using **Icarus Verilog**, with waveform outputs verified using **GTKWave**.

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Design Specification**
   - AES-128 standard selected
   - Block-based encryption (128-bit input and key)

2. **Module Development in Verilog**
   - Key Expansion
   - Initial AddRoundKey
   - SubBytes
   - ShiftRows
   - MixColumns
   - Final AddRoundKey

3. **Simulation and Verification**
   - Simulate with multiple plaintext-key pairs
   - Observe intermediate and final states using GTKWave

4. **Synthesis and FPGA Deployment**
   - Synthesized with tools like Vivado/Quartus
   - Loaded bitstream onto FPGA (e.g., Basys3 or ZCU104)

5. **On-Board Testing**
   - Serial/UART interface for plaintext input
   - Encrypted output monitored via UART/LED

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The AES encryption process follows these key steps:

1. **Key Expansion**: Derive 11 round keys from the original 128-bit key using Rijndael's key schedule.
2. **Initial Round**:
   - AddRoundKey
3. **Main Rounds (Rounds 1‚Äì9)**:
   - SubBytes (S-Box substitution)
   - ShiftRows (row-wise permutation)
   - MixColumns (column mixing using matrix multiplication)
   - AddRoundKey
4. **Final Round (Round 10)**:
   - SubBytes
   - ShiftRows
   - AddRoundKey (No MixColumns)

## üîß FPGA-Based AES-128 Implementation: Key Advantages

### ‚úÖ Pipelining Benefits
*What is Pipelining in AES on FPGA?*
*Pipelining divides the encryption process into stages, where each stage works on a different part of the input at each clock cycle‚Äîjust like an assembly line*

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Reduced Latency:** Each AES round operates in a pipeline stage, minimizing overall delay.
- üìà **Improved Throughput:** After the pipeline is filled, one encrypted block is output every clock cycle.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Deterministic Timing:** Consistent performance for real-time applications.

### üß© Parallel Processing Benefits

   *What is Parallelism in AES on FPGA?*
   *Parallelism means multiple operations are performed at the same time using separate hardware blocks.*
   
- üîÄ **Multiple AES Cores:** FPGAs can host multiple encryption engines in parallel.
- üöÄ **Increased Data Rate:** Suitable for high-speed communication systems.
- üì° **Supports Multi-stream Encryption:** Perfect for secure video/audio streaming and network encryption.
